MITRE ATT&CK:

- An excellent manual to check different types of attacks, methods to win access to an objective, ways to stay hidden.
- A perfect way to improve TTP knowledge and make some serious pain to attackers.

- The steps are Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation , Installation, Command & Control, Actions on Objectives
- Gathering info, selecting the payload, deciding the method to send it, executing the code using the vulnerability, installing a backdoor, controlling the computer, and doing the mischeivous acts.
