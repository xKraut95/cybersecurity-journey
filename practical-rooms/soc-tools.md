What I learnt about EDRs:

- A powerful tool used to monitor, analyze and respond to different threats.
- I learnt about the use of agents, telemetry, and the principles of visibility, detection and response.
- Good analysis is based on important and good quantity of data, visibility.
- EDRs analyze strange activity and behaviour, excelling typical antivirus.
- With data and analysis done, SOC members respond to the threats with different options.
- Using Machine learning and deep logic, it makes the EDR works as intended.

What I learnt about SIEM:

- A important tool to check out the logs of different endpoints.
- The 2 categories of logs, host logs and network logs.
- Centralized logs, orderer by categories and correlated by activities.
- Real time alertas and a dashboard to present information.
- The concepts of false positive, true positive.
- And some tools like Windows event visor to start analyzing events.

Also, I had some practical work simulating an organization EDR and SIEM.
