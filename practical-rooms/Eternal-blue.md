## Eternal Blue lab

Link to the room: https://tryhackme.com/room/blue


## What I learnt:

- In a controlled and intentionally vulnerable lab environment provided by TryHackMe, I practiced exploiting the EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability to understand how outdated Windows systems can be compromised through SMB.

## During this room, I:

- Identified open and vulnerable ports and services

- Used Metasploit to exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability

- Gained a Meterpreter session to interact with the target system

- Learned how attackers maintain access in poorly secured systems

- Improved my understanding of how these techniques are detected and prevented from a defensive perspective

- This exercise was performed only in a legal, educational environment and focused on improving my knowledge of system hardening, patch management, and network defense.
