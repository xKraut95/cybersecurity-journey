## Objectives:
- Learn about a known vulnerability called CVE-2024-21413, Bypassing Microsoft Office protected view.
- Creating a SMB Listener in a Kali Linux terminal to contact the mailserver
- Using a exploit, attacking another VM with this vulnerability.
- Clicking the email done by the exploit, adquiring the netNTLMv2 hash to do the mischevious act.

## What I learnt:
- The impact of vulnerabilities with real consequences.
- Rules to prevent these attacks, users don't have to click suspicious links, always preview them and calling IT department in case of these situations.
- Learnt about the solution, and how to detect these suspicious links.
- How this exploit worked, the impact and the consequences for users and companies.
- Checking the attack vector, network, small complexity and critical severity that compromises CIA triad.
- A theorical approach to Moniker Links.
